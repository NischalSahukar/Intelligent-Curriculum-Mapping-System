This application does the following:

Defines data structures for Skills, Industry Standards, Job Requirements, Learning Objectives, and Courses.
Implements a Database class to handle all database operations, including storing and retrieving data for all entities.
Implements a CurriculumMapper class with the following key functionalities:

map_course_to_industry_standards: Calculates the percentage of skills in each industry standard that are covered by a given course.
map_course_to_job_requirements: Calculates the percentage of skills in each job requirement that are covered by a given course.
suggest_curriculum_improvements: Identifies skills that are required by industry standards or job requirements but not covered in any course, and suggests adding them to the curriculum.


Provides a main function that demonstrates how to use the system with sample data.

To use this system:

Run the script. It will create a curriculum_mapping.db file in the same directory.
The main() function demonstrates how to use the system with sample data.
You can modify the sample data or add methods to input data from users or files.

This system provides a foundation for mapping course content to industry standards and job requirements. It calculates the percentage of matching content and suggests improvements to the curriculum.
You can further enhance this system by:

Implementing more sophisticated matching algorithms (e.g., using natural language processing to match skill descriptions).
Adding a user interface for easier data input and result visualization.
Implementing a feature to track curriculum changes over time and their impact on industry alignment.
Integrating with job listing APIs or web scraping tools to automatically update job requirements.
Adding a weighting system for skills to reflect their importance in different contexts.
